# The code above is a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess if a randomly generated number is even or odd.
# The code uses the random module to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
# The user is prompted to input their guess, and the program checks if the guess is correct or not.
# The program then prints the result of the guess and the randomly generated number.
# The code is simple and easy to understand, making it a good example for beginners learning Python.
# The code could be improved by adding error handling for invalid inputs and allowing the user to play multiple rounds.
# Overall, the code is a good starting point for a number guessing game and can be expanded upon with additional features.
